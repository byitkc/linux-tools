Collection of Linux Tools and Scripts for Linux Adventures

- `install.sh` - This Script is something I've started working on to help install packages that I use mostly when I want to distro hop. Just to make sure I don't miss stuff :D
- `ticket.sh` - This script will prompt for the user to enter a ticket number and will open it using the specified browser. It's a work in progress and is not functional.
